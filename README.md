# Motivation

## Udacity Data Science Project

The default branch is for development of my Projet 5 release for the Udacity nanodegree program.

## Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App

- ### The goal is to classify images of dogs according to their breed. 
- ### The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) from scratch and transfer learning 


# Quick start

The goal of the project was to take a random picture and firstly determine whether a dog or a human face can be identified. If not, the program should throw an error message. After the successful image identification - meaning either dog or human - a dog breed of the image will be shown as a result. The output can be used as a next step to develop a model that could be deployed as a web app.

# File description

### The repository has the following information included:

- A Jupyter notebook about the current algorithm steps
- A README file
- Several image files for testing purposes
- haarcascades folder
- saved_models folder
- ### Important: the bottleneck features need to be downloaded separately as the file size was too big to ulpoad for Github!

# Libraries

- Libraries used for the project:
Keras

OpenCV

Matplotlib

Numpy 

Pandas

SkLearn

Glob

PIL

#### Further steps could include:

- More analysis based on input images after data cleaning
- Apply enesmble algorithms/neural networks based on preliminary result


# Summary


The steps that are considered for the project:

    Step 0: Import Datasets
    Step 1: Detect Humans
    Step 2: Detect Dogs
    Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
    Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
    Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
    Step 6: Write your Algorithm
    Step 7: Test Your Algorithm



I wrote a quick blog post on Medium where you can find my whole story and the higlighted steps are presented.
